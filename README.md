# CRISPRpred_plus_plus
Source code of CRISPRpred++;  A Novel Tool to Predict On-target Efficiency Reducing Off-target Effects of sgRNA in CRISPR/Cas9 System.

After extraction of CRISPRpred++.zip, a folder named CRISPRpred++ will be created. This folder contains another 3 folders:
1)Non-smote: This folder contains necessary codes on benchmark dataset(imbalanced). A readme.txt is available inside it. 
2)Smote: This folder contains necessary codes for balancing techniques to overcome the issue of imbalance in dataset. A readme.txt is available inside it.
3)Graph generator: This folder contains necessary codes to draw performance measuring curves.
